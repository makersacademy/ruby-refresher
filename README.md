# Ruby Refresher

## Returning to Ruby after two weeks of JavaScript.

- Ruby Version:   2.2.1

- Dependencies:   rspec

- Test Suite:     'rspec' from the Command Line.


I'm still more comfortable in Ruby than in JavaScript. Loving the simplicity of it, though I still haven't had long enough with JavaScript to be able to compare the two fairly.

I'm eager to raise my JS to the same level as my Ruby, although I fear I may not be able to do so until my time at Maker's is over.

I found this challenge quite easy after the two week break. I'm aware I still have a great deal more to learn about Ruby, as during and after the challenge I discovered many instances where I was writing lines of code where the use of a method I didn't know existed would have done the job more succinctly.

To remedy this I need to spend some time studying the Ruby documentation.
