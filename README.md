## Ruby Refresher

39 fun Ruby Katas to get used to Ruby again after three weeks of Java Script.

# Progress
I have finished all 39 exercises that had tests. Rubocop only complains about the call_method_from_string method - which is obvious I guess.

I haven't had time to tackle the two extra tasks without tests.
