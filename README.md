## Ruby Refresher

Returning to Ruby after two weeks of JavaScript.

I'm still more comfortable in Ruby than in JavaScript. Loving the simplicity of it, though I still haven't had long enough with JavaScript to be able to compare the two fairly.

It is nice to know that I am able to navigate the basics of two languages now though.

I'm eager to raise my JS to the same level as my Ruby, although I fear I may not be able to do so until my time at Maker's is over.
