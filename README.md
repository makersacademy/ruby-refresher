## Ruby Refresher

### Task

* After a week of JavaScript, revisit the basics of Ruby by completing 41 kata which vary in difficulty.
* It was suggested that most count be answered with a couple of lines of code, and just a few methods. We were not allowed to 'hardcode' any values to make the tests pass or use any extra libraries or gems.
* We were instructed to work alone, but were allowed to use any resources to solve the questions.

### Technology

* The questions were answered using Ruby and the tests run in RSpec.

### To Run

To see my solutions to the problems and watch the specs pass
* Clone this repo
* Run `rspec` or `rspec questions_spec.rb`
* Find my soltions in `questions.rb`
