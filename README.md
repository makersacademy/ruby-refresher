# Ruby Refresher

A series of tests I completed to refresh my knowledge of Ruby before moving into Rails. 

## Installation
The following assumes you have Ruby installed:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:adc17/ruby-refresher.git`.
2. `bundle install`.

## Usage

Browse code with your favourite text editor; run tests with `rspec`. 

## Challenges

This project showed me how important it is to go away from and come back to programming tasks. I completed ~50% of this in one evening but could not find elegant solutions to the other 50%. I came back to it the next morning, and found almost all the solutions were in my head. Major action point: move between problems as much as possible when working, and give my brain time to think about them in the background.

## Other notes

A short weekend challenge from the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) Bootcamp.
